## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

npm run dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

To connect to the backend, you need to add the backend URL to your environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following line:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL==http://localhost:4000
```

Replace `http://localhost:4000` with the actual URL of your backend server.
